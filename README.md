- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zakhar Kuropiantyk
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, climbing, swimming, rehabilitation, 3d printing.... but think here you are because of programming :)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java Spring Development with [Foxminded](https://foxminded.ua/),
  - earlier Java Core, Java Multithreading, Java Collections with[JavaRush](https://javarush.com/ua/)
