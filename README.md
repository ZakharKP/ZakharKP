- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zakhar Kuropiantyk
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, climbing, swimming, rehabilitation, 3d printing.... but think here you are because of programming :)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java Spring with [Foxminded](https://foxminded.ua/),
  - earlier Java Core, Java Multithreading, Java Collections with[JavaRush](https://javarush.com/ua/)
  - and earlier Python, SQL, C, HTML,..  with [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)

- Repositories below contain some of my solutions for learning tasks:
  - [CS50 tasks](https://github.com/ZakharKP/learning_cs50tasks)
  - [Some tasks from JavaRush](https://github.com/ZakharKP/learning_javarushtasks)
